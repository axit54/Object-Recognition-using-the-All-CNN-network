# Object-Recognition-using-the-All-CNN-network

Created using the All-CNN network published in the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". This paper can be found at the following link:

This convolutional neural network obtained state-of-the-art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset in 2015. I built this model using Keras, a high-level neural network application programming interface (API) that supports both Theano and Tensorflow backends. You can use either backend; however, I used Theano.

The dataset we will be using is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
